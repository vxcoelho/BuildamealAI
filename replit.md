## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Current Implementation:**
- Tab-based navigation with 5 main sections
- Base template inheritance pattern for consistent UI/UX
- Luxury orange and black color scheme with premium typography
- Google Fonts: Playfair Display (headings) and Poppins (body)
- Professional food photography background with opacity overlay
- Responsive grid layout for recipe cards
- Active tab highlighting for navigation feedback

**Design Pattern:**
- Server-side rendering (SSR) with Jinja2 templating
- Template inheritance using `base.html` as parent template
- Dynamic content rendering from database queries
- Active tab tracking via `active_tab` parameter

**Template Structure:**
- `base.html`: Master template with navigation and shared styles
- `home.html`: Featured recipes (6 random from database)
- `browse.html`: Unlimited recipe search via TheMealDB API with cuisine filter and text search
- `generate.html`: AI recipe generation form
- `favorites.html`: Placeholder for future favorites feature
- `about.html`: Application information and features

### Backend Architecture

**Current Implementation:**
- Flask application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Multiple route handlers for tab navigation
- Database integration for recipe retrieval
- Railway deployment configuration (PORT env var, debug mode control)
- Circular import resolution via `db.init_app(app)` pattern

**Routes:**
- `/` - Home page with featured recipes
- `/browse` - Unlimited recipe search via TheMealDB API (cuisine filter + text search)
- `/generate` - AI recipe generator (POST support for form submission)
- `/favorites` - My Favorites page
- `/about` - About page

**Design Decisions:**
- **Debug Mode:** Disabled in production (checks RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT)
- **Host Configuration:** `0.0.0.0` for cloud deployment compatibility
- **Database:** SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL support
- **Circular Import Fix:** Moved `db = SQLAlchemy()` to models.py, use `db.init_app(app)` in main.py
- **Auto-Initialization:** Database tables and seed data automatically created on app startup
  - `db.create_all()` runs in app context at startup
  - 10 sample recipes auto-seeded if Recipe table is empty
  - Works seamlessly with both SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (Railway)

### Data Storage

**Current State:**
- PostgreSQL database via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Recipe model with 8 fields (id, title, ingredients, instructions, cooking_time, cuisine, calories, protein, carbs)
- MealPlan model for weekly meal planning
- 10 seeded sample recipes covering various cuisines
- SQLite fallback for local development

**Database Schema:**
```
Recipe:
  - id (Integer, Primary Key)
  - title (String, 100 chars)
  - ingredients (Text)
  - instructions (Text)
  - cooking_time (Integer, minutes)
  - cuisine (String, 50 chars) - Italian, Mexican, American, Asian, Other
  - calories (Integer, default 0)
  - protein (Integer, default 0)
  - carbs (Integer, default 0)

MealPlan:
  - id (Integer, Primary Key)
  - recipe_id (Integer, Foreign Key to Recipe)
  - date (Date)
  - meal_type (String, 20 chars) - breakfast, lunch, dinner
  - created_at (DateTime)
```

### Authentication & Authorization

**Current State:**
- No authentication or authorization implemented

**Future Requirements:**
- User registration and login system likely needed for personalized meal plans
- Session management for maintaining user state
- Possible integration with OAuth providers (Google, Facebook) for social login

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies

**Flask:**
- Purpose: Web framework providing routing, templating, and request handling
- Version: Not specified in repository (should be added to requirements.txt)

### Missing Infrastructure

**Requirements File:**
- No `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` present
- Should include: Flask, and future dependencies (database drivers, authentication libraries, etc.)

**Environment Configuration:**
- No `.env` file or environment variable management
- Future needs: database URLs, API keys, secret keys for sessions

### Anticipated Future Dependencies

**Database:**
- Database driver (psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, or appropriate driver for chosen database)
- ORM/Query builder (SQLAlchemy, Drizzle, or similar)

**Authentication:**
- Flask-Login or similar session management
- Password hashing library (bcrypt, Werkzeug's security module)
- Possible OAuth libraries for social authentication

**API Integrations:**
- Potential nutrition API for ingredient data
- Recipe APIs for meal suggestions
- Email service for notifications (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)

**Frontend Enhancement:**
- CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, or similar) for responsive design
- JavaScript framework possibility (Vue.js, React, or Alpine.js) for interactive features
